concern -  Figure out the Icon thing

I'm seeing that Socrata is changing on June 9
and I'm wondering how worth it is to look at details
when some of the details might be changing in two weeks

The NYC endpoint
https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9

The SF311 endpoint  (but I want to make this easily variable)



Stopping development on this project.   Gonna look at the icon thing.

This is a good example, but its not that close to what i want to be doing.  
So my time is going to be spent elsewhere.
